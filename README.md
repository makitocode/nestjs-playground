# NestJS Playground

Welcome to the **NestJS Playground**! ðŸŽ‰

This repository serves as a collection of proof-of-concept implementations using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework. The goal is to explore and experiment with various NestJS features and integrations, ranging from simple CRUD operations to advanced topics like microservices, real-time communication, and more.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive set of NestJS examples that cover a wide array of use cases. This includes:

- Building foundational knowledge with basic CRUD operations.
- Experimenting with NestJS modules, controllers, and services.
- Exploring advanced NestJS patterns such as microservices, middleware, and custom decorators.
- Testing integrations with various databases, authentication mechanisms, and third-party APIs.
- Developing real-time applications using WebSockets, GraphQL, and other communication protocols.
- Investigating streaming capabilities and data flow management.
- Implementing authorization and security best practices.

This playground aims to be a resource for both learning and reference, providing clear and concise implementations of complex concepts.

## Technologies

- **NestJS** - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **GraphQL** - Query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.
- **WebSockets** - Communication protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- **MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL** - Examples using different databases for data persistence.

## Features

The repository includes examples of:

- Basic and advanced CRUD operations.
- NestJS Modules, Controllers, and Providers patterns.
- Real-time communication using WebSockets.
- GraphQL API integration.
- RESTful APIs with proper versioning and Swagger documentation.
- Middleware and Guards for request handling and authorization.
- Microservices architecture with RabbitMQ or Kafka.
- JWT and OAuth2 authentication strategies.
- Stream processing and data manipulation.
- Custom decorators and interceptors.
- Testing strategies using Jest and Supertest.
